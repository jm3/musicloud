h2. Problems:

* The ID3 "Genre" field is a scalar rather than a list, therefore any song which straddles or combines more than one genre is inherently uncategorizable. Library scientists evidentally call this, "The Bookshelf Problem" - while a book may be categorized in many ways, it can only physically be on one shelf at a time. iTunes has the Bookshelf Problem. 

* Since your iTunes playlists exist only in your iTunes metadata file, they are not portable to eg. linux, and will be lost if your iTunes data is ever corrupted.

h3. Enter Musicloud.

1. When adding a new song to your iTunes, use the "Grouping" field to enter a list of ALL genres that apply to the song.
2. Run musicloud.rb on your iTunes Music directory.
3. Paste the output into http://www.wordle.net/
4. Voila
